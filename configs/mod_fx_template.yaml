      <br><br>In this test you will be asked to rate audio clips by how closely they match a reference clip. 
      <br><br>There is one training example then 15 tests to complete. It should take no longer than 15-20 mins.'

      content: 'This is a training example to show you how to use the user interface (your results will not be recorded). Please read all of the following before continuing to the test. 
       <br><br> <strong>MUSHRA</strong> stands for <strong>MU</strong>ltiple <strong>S</strong>timuli <strong>H</strong>idden <strong>R</strong>eference and <strong>A</strong>nchor
       <br><br> <strong>YOUR TASK:</strong> rate each Condition (or stimulus) below by how closely
        it sounds like the Reference. 
        <br><br> <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> the Reference itself will <em>always</em> be hidden amongst the Conditions. If you identify the hidden reference, you <em>must</em> rate this 100. 
        <br><br> In other words, you should always rate <em>at least</em> one clip 100. 

        <br><br> In the example below, the clips are labelled (e.g. reference, anchor) but this information is hidden in the real test and the conditions are randomised. 
        <br><br> Feel free to listen as many times as you need and to loop segments.
        <br><br> Useful keyboard shortcuts: SPACE - play/pause; R - play/pause
        reference; NUMBERS - play/pause condition by number; BACKSPACE - stop.'
